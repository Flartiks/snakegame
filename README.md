# snakegame C++ SFML
There are no apples spawn in this game right now. There is only a background and a snake moving on WASD.

# How to build?
On linux - `Cmake -B build`
then - `Cmake --build build`

If you use mingw(Minimalist GNU for Windows):
`Cmake -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles"`
then - `Cmake --build build`
